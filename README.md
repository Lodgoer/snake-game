🐍 Snake Game (Python Turtle)

A simple yet fun Snake Game built using the turtle graphics library in Python.

🎮 Features

Move the snake with arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →)

Eat apples to grow and increase your score

Background image support (.gif format)

Fixed window size (700×600)

Game over when hitting walls or itself

Animated "🔥 GAME OVER 🔥" message

🖼️ Background Setup

If you want to use a custom background image:

Place your .gif file (e.g., background.gif) in the same folder as the Python file.

Make sure the image size matches 700×600 pixels.

The game will automatically load it; if not found, a plain green background will be used instead.

🚀 How to Run
python snake.py


Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

📦 Requirements

No external dependencies — only Python’s built-in turtle, time, and random libraries are used.

🧠 Future Improvements

Add restart button (R key)

Add sound effects for eating and collision

Add score persistence and high scores

Add dynamic speed increase as the snake grows
